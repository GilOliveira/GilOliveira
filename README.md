### Hello! 👋

👨‍🔬 I'm a researcher at the [Department of Chemistry](https://dq.fct.unl.pt/en/) of the [NOVA School of Science & Technology](https://fct.unl.pt/) at [NOVA University Lisbon](https://www.unl.pt/en/), I'm a member of the [Systems Biology and Engineering Group](https://sites.fct.unl.pt/sbegroup), which is part of the [Associated Laboratory for Green Chemistry - LAQV REQUIMTE](https://laqv.requimte.pt/), and I'm currently doing research on hybrid metabolic modelling of human cells.

🧬 I'm a Molecular Biologist by training and I hold a MSc degree in Biotechnology.

💻 I can code in Python, C, R, MATLAB, and JavaScript. I also know HTML, CSS, LaTeX and a bit of bash.

🔎 Here you can find the code I do for work, fun as well as contributions to open source projects. My open source code can be found on multiple hosting services: [sourcehut](https://git.sr.ht/~gpo), [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/Gil), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/GilOliveira), and [GitHub](https://github.com/GilOliveira.
