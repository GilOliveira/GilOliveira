### Hello! 👋

👨‍🔬 I'm a student researcher at the [Department of Chemistry](https://dq.fct.unl.pt/en) of the [NOVA School of Science & Technology](https://fct.unl.pt), I'm a member of the [Systems Biology and Engineering Group](https://sites.fct.unl.pt/sbegroup) and I'm currently doing research on hybrid metabolic modelling of human cells.

🧬 I'm a Molecular Biologist by training.

✨ I also have a blog which focuses on science communication. Seems interesting? [Check it out!](https://foradabancada.pt/en)
