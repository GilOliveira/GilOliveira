### Hello! 👋

👨‍🔬 I'm a research fellow at the [Department of Chemistry](https://dq.fct.unl.pt/en/) of the [NOVA School of Science & Technology](https://fct.unl.pt/) at [NOVA University Lisbon](https://www.unl.pt/en/), I'm a member of the [Systems Biology and Engineering Group](https://sites.fct.unl.pt/sbegroup), which is part of the [Associated Laboratory for Green Chemistry - LAQV REQUIMTE](https://laqv.requimte.pt/), and I'm currently doing research on hybrid metabolic modelling of human cells.

🧬 I'm a Molecular Biologist by training and I'm working on my MSc in Biotechnology.

✨ I also have a blog which focuses on science communication. Seems interesting? [Check it out!](https://foradabancada.pt/en)

💻 I can code in Python, R, and Javascript, but I'm currently using MATLAB for work. I also know HTML, CSS, LaTeX and a bit of bash.
